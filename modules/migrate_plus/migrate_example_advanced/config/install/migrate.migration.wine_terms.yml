  # Usually, one wants to have a separate migration for each entity_type/bundle
  # combination - e.g., separate migrations for articles and blog posts, as
  # opposed to a single monolithic node migration. This affords maximum
  # control - the ability to import just one bundle at a time, and most
  # importantly to have distinct field mappings (because different node types
  # usually have different fields). In this case, though, because all of the
  # vocabularies we're importing come from a common table, and on the Drupal
  # side there are no distinct custom fields, we are able to import them all in
  # one migration. The static_map tells the migration in which vocabulary to
  # place each term, based on the incoming 'type' column.
