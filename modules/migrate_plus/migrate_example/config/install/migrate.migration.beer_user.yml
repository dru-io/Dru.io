  # Here's a new process plugin - dedupe_entity. Our source site allowed there
  # to be multiple user accounts with the same username, but Drupal wants
  # usernames to be unique. This plugin allows us to automatically generate
  # unique usernames when we detect collisions.
  name:
    plugin: dedupe_entity
    # The name of the source field containing the username.
    source: username
    # These next two settings identify the destination-side field to check for
    # duplicates. They say "see if the incoming 'name' matches any existing
    # 'name' field in any 'user' entity".
    entity_type: user
    field: name
    # Finally, this specifies a string to use between the original value and the
    # sequence number appended to make the value unique. Thus, the first 'alice'
    # account gets the name 'alice' in Drupal, and the second one gets the name
    # 'alice_1'.
    postfix: _

  # Another new process plugin - callback. This allows us to filter an incoming
  # source value through an arbitrary PHP function. The function called must
  # have one required argument.
  created:
    plugin: callback
    # The 'registered' timestamp in the source data is a string of the form
    # 'yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss', but Drupal wants a UNIX timestamp for 'created'.
    source: registered
    callable: strtotime

  # Our source data only has a single timestamp value, 'registered', which we
  # want to use for all four of Drupal's user timestamp fields. We could
  # duplicate the callback plugin we used for 'created' above - but we have a
  # shortcut. Putting an @ sign at the beginning of the source value indicates
  # that it is to be interpreted as a *destination* field name instead of a
  # *source* field name. Thus, if a value we need in more than one place
  # requires some processing beyond simply copying it directly, we can perform
  # that processing a single time and use the result in multiple places.
  changed: '@created'
  access: '@created'
  login: '@created'

  # Yet another new process plugin - static_map. We're making a transformation
  # in how we represent gender data - formerly it was integer values 0 for male
  # and 1 for female, but in our modern Drupal site we will be making this a
  # free-form text field, so we want to replace the obscure integers with
  # simple strings.
  field_migrate_example_gender:
    plugin: static_map
    # Specify the source field we're reading (containing 0's and 1's).
    source: sex
    # Tell it to transform 0 to 'Male', and 1 to 'Female'.
    map:
      0: Male
      1: Female

  field_migrate_example_favbeers: beers
  # The following is blocked on https://www.drupal.org/node/2590993.

  # This looks like a simple migration process plugin, but there's magic
  # happening here. We import nodes after terms and users, because they have
  # references to terms and users, so of course the terms and users must be
  # migrated first - right? However, the favbeers field is a reference to the
  # beer nodes which haven't yet been migrated - we have a circular relationship
  # between users and nodes. The way the migration system resolves this
  # situation is by creating stubs. In this case, because no beer nodes have
  # been created, each time a beer is looked up against the beer_node migration
  # nothing is found, and by default the migration process plugin creates an
  # empty stub node as a placeholder so the favbeers reference field has
  # something to point to. The stub is recorded in the beer_node map table, so
  # when that migration runs it knows that each incoming beer should overwrite
  # its stub instead of creating a new node.
