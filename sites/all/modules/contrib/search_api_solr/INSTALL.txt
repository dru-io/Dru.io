Setting up Solr
---------------

In order for this module to work, you will first need to set up a Solr server.
For this, you can either purchase a server from a web Solr hosts or set up your
own Solr server on your web server (if you have the necessary rights to do so).
If you want to use a hosted solution, a number of companies are listed on the
module's project page [1]. Otherwise, please follow the instructions below.
A more detailed set of instructions is available at [2].

[1] https://drupal.org/project/search_api_solr
[2] https://drupal.org/node/1999310

As a pre-requisite for running your own Solr server, you'll need Java 6 or
higher.

Download the latest version of Solr 4.x from [3] and unpack the archive
somewhere outside of your web server's document tree.

[3] http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/lucene/solr/

This module also supports Solr 3.x. For better performance and more features,
4.x should be used, though.

For small websites, using the example application, located in $SOLR/example/,
usually suffices. In any case, you can use it for developing and testing. The
following instructions will assume you are using the example application,
otherwise you should be able to substitute the corresponding paths.

CAUTION! For production sites, it is vital that you somehow prevent outside
access to the Solr server. Otherwise, attackers could read, corrupt or delete
all your indexed data. Using the example server WON'T prevent this by default.
If it is available, the probably easiest way of preventing this is to disable
outside access to the ports used by Solr through your server's network
configuration or through the use of a firewall.
Other options include adding basic HTTP authentication or renaming the solr/
directory to a random string of characters and using that as the path.

Before starting the Solr server you will have to make sure it uses the proper
configuration files. These are located in the solr-conf/ directory in this
module, in a sub-directory according to the Solr version you are using. Copy all
the files from that directory into Solr's configuration directory
($SOLR/example/solr/collection1/conf/ in case of the 4.x example application),
after backing up all files that would be overwritten.

NOTE: The mapping-ISOLatin1Accent.txt is only included in the module for
completeness' sake, as it is required to start the Solr server. It will be
usually advisable to just use the file of the example application in this case,
though, as it contains really useful definitions, while the file provided with
this module is empty, apart from some documentation. For licensing reasons, it
is not possible for us to include the definitions in the example config file in
the copy this module provides.

You can then start Solr. For the example application, go to $SOLR/example/ and
issue the following command (assuming Java is correctly installed):

java -jar start.jar &

Afterwards, go to [4] in your web browser to ensure Solr is running correctly.

[4] http://localhost:8983/solr/

You can then enable this module and create a new server, using the "Solr search"
service class. Enter the hostname, port and path corresponding to your Solr
server in the appropriate fields. The default values already correspond to the
example application, so you won't have to change the values if you use that.
If you are using HTTP Authentication to protect your Solr server you also have
to provide the appropriate user and password here.

NOTE: For Solr 4.x, the server's path should also contain the Solr core name.
E.g., when using the example application unchanged, set the path to
"/solr/collection1" instead of "/solr".
